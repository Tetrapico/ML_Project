## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview ðŸ”¹

In todayâ€™s digital era, choosing a movie to watch can be a challenging task due to the vast number of options. This project aims to solve that by providing a way for users to discover new films based on their preferences.
Using the **TMDb Movie Metadata** dataset, we extract semantic information (genres, keywords, overviews) for each movie and compute their similarity scores to enable personalized recommendations.


## ðŸ”¹ Methodology ðŸ”¹

* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * Text cleaned by lowercasing and removing punctuation
  * Stopwords removed
* **Vectorization (TF-IDF):**
  Each movieâ€™s content is represented as a numerical vector.
* **Similarity Computation (Cosine Similarity):**
  Pair-wise similarity scores are computed to identify the most similar films.
* **Recommendation:**
  Given a movie title, the algorithm ranks and produces the most similar films.


## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack ðŸ”¹

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** â€” for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** â€” for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
* **Jupyter notebook** â€” for interactive exploration
* **TMDb Movie Metadata** â€” for the dataset (available on Kaggle)


## ðŸ”¹ Installation ðŸ”¹

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tetrapico/ML_Project.git
cd ML_Project
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## ðŸ”¹ How to Use ðŸ”¹

* Open `movie_recommender.ipynb` in **Jupyter notebook**.
* Run all cells in the notebook.
* Call the `recommend()` function with a movie title to retrieve its top 5 most similar films.



## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement Ideas ðŸ”¹

* Implement **collaborative filtering** alongside content-based filtering.
* Utilize **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)** for semantic understanding.
* Include additional metadata (actor, crew, box office) to aid in recommendations.
